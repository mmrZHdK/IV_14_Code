It is more likely to be correct because the solution is expressed in a vocabulary that corresponds to the problem being solved. Summing a range of numbers isnâ€™t about loops and counters. It is about ranges and sums.


In the context of programming, these kinds of vocabularies are usually called abstractions. Abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level.


It has to become second nature, for a programmer, to notice when a concept is begging to be abstracted into a new word.


Higher-order functions allow us to abstract over actions, not just values.
